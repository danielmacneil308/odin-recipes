    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I'll admit, I had to do a bit of research on where “Tuscan chicken” actually originated from. But it seems like there's no one strict answer. My two cents is that it's a spin on a classic Italian Florentine sauce, which is made from white wine, cream, and spinach. Then it was given a Tuscan twist by adding garlic and sun-dried tomatoes to the warm cream and spinach base.
        But what really popularized this dish (at least in America) was Olive Garden's Tuscan Garlic Chicken, a dish with a similar flavor profile, served over fettuccine.
        Either way, I'm glad this Tuscan chicken became a trend because it's literally the best thing ever. Especially when you're craving something rich and cheesy, with an Italian flair.

        <li>1 lb Penne or other pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <h3>For the Chicken and Sauce:</h3>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive or vegtable oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>8.5 ounce jar sundried tomatoes in oil, drained</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried italian seasoning</li>
        <li>¾ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 ½ cup cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>Red pepper flakes (salt, and pepper to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain and toss with butter.</li>
        <li>Optional: For quicker, more even cooking, slightly flatten breasts with a kitchen mallet. If they are very thick, slice them in half horizontally before flattening. </li>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over high heat. When pan is hot, add 1 tablespoon oil.</li>
        <li>When oil is hot, put chicken breasts in pan and cook until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. Remove chicken from pan.</li>
        <li>Let chicken cool for a few minutes, then slice. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add remaining tablespoon oil to pan. Add onions and cook until softened.</li>
        <li>Add red bell pepper and cook until almost softened.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, sundried tomatoes, and Italian seasoning. Stir, and cook for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Deglaze pan with broth, scraping bottom to release any bits sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add cream and bring to a simmer. Allow to simmer for 2 minutes. Add parmesan and cook until melted.</li>
        <li>When cheese is melted turn off the heat and stir in baby spinach.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Combine pasta, chicken, and sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve.</li>
